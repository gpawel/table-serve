Me: you can find files with screen shots at description/screens
The application is a set of "lessons" with quizes, some practical game-like excercises and as a bonus for a passed lessong some funny story related to the lesson.
ChatGPT helped me to build the "demo" app. The main goal to have something to show to potential investors.
The code and screenshots you see are the current state.
There are still several features to do and I would like to switch for help here from ChatGPT because it is much more convinient.

Codex:
Absolutely. To continue, I need a bit more direction. What’s the highest‑priority goal right now?

Pick one (or tell me another):

Design polish on specific screens (which page?)
New feature/functionality (describe desired behavior)
Test fixes or new tests (which flows failing/missing?)
Bug fixes (what’s broken?)
Also tell me if you have any visual references or product requirements.

Me:
in what form can I provide you the visual reference? I cat take several screen shots for example or url to the locally runnig app.
after that I can explain you what the app is about.


Screenshots are perfect. You can share 2–5 key screens (home, lesson, stories, any problem area). If it’s a local app URL, I can’t access it directly, but a screen capture works great.

Also helpful:

Target audience + style goals (e.g., “warm, elegant, modern”).
Any existing brand colors or fonts.
Priority pages to redesign first.

Me
screen shots' names corespond to what they are.  hope_page_1 shows first part of the home page.
learn_and_quize_page shows a template for a lesson and quize related to lesson's topic.
learn_page is a container where user can navigate through available lessons.
For the demo we don't use back end. just local browser storage.
At this point I don't know what an investor will want. I want something that will be good enouth for demo - it will be no shame to demo it.
The color schema - let's leave it like this. my business partners may want to change it later.
my next immideate priority would be to take css outside of the code and make it a separated file that will be referenced from code.
