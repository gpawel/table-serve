Goal:
Extract inline styles from React components into external CSS files, keeping the UI visually identical.

Context:
This is a demo React + Vite app (TableServing.app) built for investor demos.
There is no backend; progress is stored in localStorage.
Automated tests (Vitest + Testing Library) already exist and must remain valid.

Scope (files to refactor):
- src/layout/Layout.tsx
- src/pages/HomePage.tsx
- src/pages/LearnPage.tsx
- src/pages/LessonPage.tsx
- src/pages/StoriesPage.tsx
- src/pages/StoryPage.tsx
- Any small shared components if needed

Styling requirements:
- Use plain CSS (no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS, no new libraries).
- Create 1 primary CSS file, max 2 if truly needed.
  Suggested location:
    - src/styles/global.css
- Import CSS once at app entry (e.g., main.tsx).
- Replace inline style objects with className-based styles.
- Prefer reusable classes (container, header, nav, card, button, muted text).
- Avoid global tag selectors (no `h1 {}` or `div p` rules).

Constraints:
- Do NOT redesign the UI.
- Do NOT change spacing, colors, fonts, or layout behavior.
- Do NOT change visible text (button labels, headings, messages).
- Do NOT change routing, logic, or state behavior.

Test safety (important):
- Keep existing DOM structure as stable as possible.
- Do not remove elements that tests rely on.
- Avoid changing text content used by tests.
- If adding className wrappers, do not break existing accessibility roles.
- All existing tests must continue to pass.

Verification:
- npm run ci must pass (lint, typecheck, tests, build).
- Manual smoke test:
  - Home → Learn → Lesson 1 → complete quiz → Stories → open unlocked story.

Deliverable:
- Cleaned React components with no inline styles.
- One (or at most two) well-organized CSS files.
- No test regressions.
